TCP CHINA
========

`TCP-CHINA` Congestion control algorithm, based on very few modifications
to `TCP-AFRICA`. 

Modifications are simple: Always keep using fast mode of `TCP_AFRICA`.

This is yet another demostration of how easily we can increase TCP sending speed
from the server side if you ignore fairness and friendliness.
